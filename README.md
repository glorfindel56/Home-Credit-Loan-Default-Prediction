## Project Overview

This repository contains our data analysis project focusing on predictive modeling using random forests and other statistical techniques. Our aim is to predict a binary target variable using a set of predictors, following a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection process.

## Repository Structure

### `Code`
Contains all the R and Python scripts used for data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and modeling.

### `Data`
Raw and processed data files. All code results are moved here.
- `application_imputed.csv`: Cleaned and imputed dataset used for modeling.

### `Final Report`
Comprehensive report of the findings, methodology, and conclusions of the analysis.
*Note: Unnecessary files have been removed for clarity.*

### `Visualizations`
Graphical representations and plots generated during the EDA and modeling stages.

## Google Drive
- Documents and Resources will be placed in this Google Drive shared folder. Collaborations like the Group Project Proposal will be done over a Google Doc document, when ready will be exported and added to this Repo as a .PDF.

## Branching and Contributions
- Please checkout the develop branch and work from there. All code will be pushed to the 'develop' branch. Branches can be created off of develop as needed.
- Official changes made to the project will be merged into 'main' by Pull requests on GitLab.

## Usage
- Refer to `Code/` for data exploration and preprocessing steps.
- Use `Data/` as a source for raw and preprocessed data.
- Find analysis results and discussions in `Final Report/`.
- Access `Visualizations/` for figures and plots illustrating the data and modeling results.
