## Project Overview

The core objective of our project is to explore the potential of analytic techniques in addressing a critical challenge faced by financial institutions: evaluating loan eligibility for clients with limited or no credit history. This segment of the population, often unbanked, faces difficulties in securing loans from traditional banks due to their inadequate credit background. Home Credit, a primary lender for such clients, aims to harness alternative data to predict loan default probabilities effectively.

The business rationale for this initiative is multifaceted. By accurately predicting defaults, Home Credit can not only safeguard against revenue loss but also enhance its profitability through the preservation of unrealized interest income. Furthermore, the insights gained from demographic and financial data could enable more targeted and effective marketing strategies, attracting high-value customer segments prone to successful loan repayment. This approach is expected to not only yield financial benefits but also boost the company's reputation, allowing it to offer more favorable loan conditions to creditworthy individuals, thereby fostering trust and building a stronger customer base.

The central problem our team seeks to solve is the development of a reliable predictive model that can assess the likelihood of loan default without relying on traditional credit scores. Our working hypothesis posits that demographic information, in conjunction with variables such as loan amount and annual income, will serve as significant predictors of loan repayment outcomes. We anticipate that a regularized logistic regression model will be the most effective in capturing the underlying patterns and signals within the data.

## Repository Structure

### `Code`
Contains all the R and Python scripts used for data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and modeling.

### `Data`
Raw and processed data files. All code results are moved here.
- `application_imputed_cleaner_v3.csv`: Cleaned and imputed dataset used for modeling.

### `Final Report`
Comprehensive report of the findings, methodology, and conclusions of the analysis.
*Note: Unnecessary files have been removed for clarity.*

### `Visualizations`
Graphical representations and plots generated during the EDA and modeling stages.

## Google Drive
- Documents and Resources will be placed in this Google Drive shared folder. Collaborations like the Group Project Proposal will be done over a Google Doc document, when ready will be exported and added to this Repo as a .PDF.

## Branching and Contributions
- Please checkout the develop branch and work from there. All code will be pushed to the 'develop' branch. Branches can be created off of develop as needed.
- Official changes made to the project will be merged into 'main' by Pull requests on GitLab.

## Usage
- Refer to `Code/` for data exploration and preprocessing steps.
- Use `Data/` as a source for raw and preprocessed data.
- Find analysis results and discussions in `Final Report/`.
- Access `Visualizations/` for figures and plots illustrating the data and modeling results.
